## About Me
I'm Niels, an 18-year-old student at Howest, currently studying in the 1MCT program. I have a strong passion for technology and software development, and I am working on expanding my skills in various programming languages. I have experience creating games and using the 'Verse' programming language in UEFN (Unreal Engine for Fortnite).

I am currently focusing on projects within my studies, especially in software development and emerging technologies. In addition to my studies, I am also part of a small startup clothing brand, where I collaborate with a small team.

## Goals
- Improve my programming skills in languages like Python and JavaScript.
- Learn more about software engineering and technology.
